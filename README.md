## This is a project made for OOP-practise, but with focus on Enums!  
Who know, maybe this is a start for a java-based game? :D  

This "simulates" the creation of a character in a sci-fi based game:  

Default-enums:  
      Faction =     ALLY, NEUTRAL, ENEMY  
      Species =     HUMAN, ANDROID, CYBORG  
      
Weapon-enums:  
      ExplosiveWeapons = ROCKET_LAUNCHER, PLASMA_LAUNCHER, PHOTON_BLASTER, NONE  
      LightWeapons = LASER_DAGGER, PLASMA_SWORD, SMALL_HAMMER, NONE  
      PrimaryWeapons = LASER_RIFLE, PLASMA_RIFLE, ELECTRO_BLASTER, NONE  
      SecondaryWeapons = LASER_GUN, LASER_GUN, GRAVITY_GUN, NONE
